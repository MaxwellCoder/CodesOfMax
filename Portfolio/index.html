	<h1>About Me</h1>
	<hr> 
<p>
	I have always been interested in learning to code, and also work with others across the world to help get a better understanding of software engineering, hence why I enrolled in this program. Outside of web development, I enjoy having social outings, going to conventions about anything, and playing video games.
