	<h2>About Me</h2>
	<hr> 
<p>
	I have always been interested in learning to code and also working with others across the world to help get a better understanding of software engineering, hence why I enrolled in this program. Outside of web development, I enjoy having social outings, going to conventions about anything, and playing video games.

	Here are a few things that interest me
	<ul>
			<li>Video Game Programming</li>
				<li>Website development</li>
					<li>Excel</li>
						<li>Streaming content
		</li>
	</ul>
